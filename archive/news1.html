        <p><strong>LOS ANGELES</strong> — The entertainment industry is in mourning following the passing of <strong>Eric Dane</strong>, the beloved actor who became a global icon as Dr. Mark "McSteamy" Sloan on <em>Grey’s Anatomy</em>. Dane passed away on February 19, 2026, at the age of 53, after a courageous and private two-year battle with <strong>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)</strong>.</p>

        <p>Known for his rugged good looks and undeniable screen presence, Dane’s transition from a television heartthrob to a powerhouse dramatic actor in <em>Euphoria</em> was one of the most respected career evolutions in Hollywood.</p>

        <h2>A Private Battle with ALS</h2>
        <p>Dane was diagnosed with ALS in late 2024. While the news remained private for several months, he eventually shared his diagnosis with the public in April 2025. In his final year, he became a tireless advocate for the ALS community, using his platform to push for increased research funding and faster access to experimental treatments. His last public appearance in <strong>Washington D.C.</strong> earlier this year left a lasting impact on legislators and fans alike.</p>

        <div style="background: #f1f5f9; padding: 25px; border-left: 5px solid var(--red); border-radius: 8px; margin: 30px 0; font-style: italic;">
            "I’ve spent a lifetime playing characters who were in control. This journey has taught me that true power lies in vulnerability." — Eric Dane (2025).
        </div>

        <h2>The McSteamy Era and Beyond</h2>
        <p>While Eric Dane had a prolific career, it was his 2006 debut on <em>Grey’s Anatomy</em> that changed everything. As Mark Sloan, he brought a unique blend of arrogance and vulnerability that made him an instant fan favorite. After leaving the medical drama, he proved his leading-man status in the action-packed series <em>The Last Ship</em>, where he played Captain Tom Chandler.</p>

        <p>However, it was his role as Cal Jacobs in HBO’s <em>Euphoria</em> that redefined his legacy. His portrayal of a repressed, complex father earned him some of the best reviews of his career, proving that his talent went far beyond his "McSteamy" persona.</p>

        <h2>The Final Interview and Netflix Documentary</h2>
        <p>Fans are eagerly awaiting the posthumous release of the Netflix documentary titled <strong>"Famous Last Words."</strong> Recorded during the final months of his life, the film captures Dane’s reflections on fame, fatherhood, and his journey with a terminal illness. He reportedly shared emotional final scenes with his former co-stars, ensuring his legacy was captured with the same honesty he brought to his roles.</p>

        <p>Eric Dane is survived by his former wife, Rebecca Gayheart, and their two daughters, Billie and Georgia. His family has requested that donations be made to ALS research foundations to continue the fight he started.</p>
